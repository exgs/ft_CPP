Life can be stressful—you may feel stressed about performance at school,
traumatic events (such as a pandemic, natural disaster, or act of violence), or a life change.
Everyone feels stress from time to time.
What is stress? Stress is the physical or mental response to an external cause, such as having
a lot of homework or having an illness. A stressor may be a one-time or short-term occurrence,
or it can happen repeatedly over a long time.

What is anxiety? Anxiety is your body's reaction to stress and can occur even if there is no current threat.
If that anxiety doesn’t go away and begins to interfere with your life, it could affect your health.
You could experience problems with sleeping, or with your immune, digestive, cardiovascular, and 
reproductive systems. You also may be at higher risk for developing a mental illness such as an anxiety 
disorder or depression
