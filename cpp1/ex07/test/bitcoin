Understanding Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a collection of computers, or nodes, that all run Bitcoin's code and store its blockchain.
A blockchain can be thought of as a collection of blocks. In each block is a collection of transactions. 
Because all these computers running the blockchain have the same list of blocks and transactions and can 
transparently see these new blocks being filled with new Bitcoin transactions, no one can cheat the system. 
Anyone, whether they run a Bitcoin "node" or not, can see these transactions occurring live. 
In order to achieve a nefarious act, a bad actor would need to operate 51% of the computing power 
that makes up Bitcoin. Bitcoin has around 47,000 nodes as of May 2020 and this number is growing,
making such an attack quite unlikely.4ï»¿
